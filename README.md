1. Four JSONs builded, each one representing a different resume section.
* `bio` contains:

            name : string
            role : string
            contacts : an object with
                  mobile: string
                  email: string
                  github: string
                  twitter: string
                  location: string
            welcomeMessage: string
            skills: array of strings
            biopic: url
            display: function taking no parameters

* `education` contains:

            schools: array of objects with
                 name: string
                 location: string
                 degree: string
                 majors: array of strings
                 dates: integer (graduation date)
                 url: string
            onlineCourses: array with
                 title: string
                 school: string
                 date: integer (date finished)
                 url: string
            display: function taking no parameters

* `work` contains

            jobs: array of objects with
                 employer: string
                 title: string
                 location: string
                 dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
                 description: string
            display: function taking no parameters

* `projects` contains:

            projects: array of objects with
                  title: string
                  dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
                  description: string
                  images: array with string urls
            display: function taking no parameters

2. Iterate through each JSON and append its information to index.html in the correct section.
 * jQuery’s `selector.append()` and `selector.prepend()` functions to modify index.html. `selector.append()` makes an element appear at the end of a selected section. `selector.prepend()` makes an element appear at the beginning of a selected section.
